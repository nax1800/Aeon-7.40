# Aeon-7.40

**Fortnite 7.40 GameServer**
<br/>
<br/>
This is just a simple gameserver for 7.40 which is being made and will receive occasional updates until it's playable, maybe near 1:1.
<br/>
<br/>
**NAMESPACES AND FILES**
<br/>
The namespaces, files and layout are different than what you may normally see, this is so it is easy to read and navigate. 
<br/>
**Handlers:** Handles everything efficiently.
<br/>
**Managers:** Manages everything easily.
<br/>
**Hooks:** Contains all the Hooks of functions.
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't planned on being used at all, you may use it and port it to other versions if you'd like, **with credit**.
<br/>
There will be no support on how to set this up and use it as it should be pretty clear.
<br/>
<br/>
*This is just so I could expand my knowledge and provide, this could also be used to understand how servers work.*
